# SEO Implementation Guide

This document provides an overview of the SEO implementation for the Brashline website. It covers the a-z of the SEO architecture, from the core meta tags to the structured data and sitemap.

## Core Concepts

The SEO implementation is built around a centralized `MetaManager` component, which is responsible for rendering all of the SEO-related tags in the `<head>` of the document. This component is designed to be a single source of truth for all things SEO, with a focus on best practices from `joshbuchea/HEAD`.

The `MetaManager` component is used on every page of the site, and it is passed a `pageSEO` object that contains the title, description, and other meta-data for the current page. This object is generated by the `getPageSEO` utility function, which is located in `src/utils/seo.ts`.

## Structured Data

The website uses JSON-LD to provide structured data to search engines. The structured data is generated by a series of utility functions in `src/utils/seo.ts`, and it is rendered by the `StructuredData` component.

The `StructuredData` component is used on every page of the site, and it is responsible for rendering the `LocalBusiness`, `Organization`, and page-specific structured data.

## Sitemap

The website has a dynamic XML sitemap that is generated by the `scripts/generate-sitemap.js` script. This script is run automatically as part of the build process, and it creates a `sitemap.xml` file in the `public` directory.

## Robots.txt

The website has a `robots.txt` file in the `public` directory that provides instructions to search engine crawlers. This file includes a link to the sitemap, and it is configured to allow all crawling.

## Icons and Manifest

The website has a comprehensive set of icons and a web app manifest that are located in the `public` directory. These files are used to improve the user experience and to ensure that the website is properly configured for PWA functionality.

## Performance and Hygiene

The website uses a number of techniques to improve performance and hygiene. These include:

-   Resource hints, such as `dns-prefetch` and `preload`, to optimize the loading of critical assets.
-   A centralized `MetaManager` component to avoid duplicate or obsolete tags in the `<head>`.
-   A dynamic sitemap to help search engines discover and index the website's content more efficiently.

## Breadcrumbs and Internal Linking

The website has a `Breadcrumbs` component that is responsible for rendering the breadcrumbs and the corresponding JSON-LD markup. This component is used on every page of the site, and it helps users to navigate the website more easily.
