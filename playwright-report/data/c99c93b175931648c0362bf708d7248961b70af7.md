          - paragraph [ref=e72]: Brashline helps businesses stay visible online with affordable plans, consistent content, and measurable results — no jargon, no fluff, just progress that lasts.

            - heading "Our Story" [level=2] [ref=e76]
            - paragraph [ref=e77]: Brashline started as a simple idea between a few friends rooted in technology and design. Each had spent years helping local businesses build websites, manage social media, and solve digital problems that bigger agencies ignored. What they discovered was clear — small business owners weren't lacking ambition; they were being priced out of the digital world.
            - paragraph [ref=e78]: "Professional agencies charged thousands for what most people really needed: visibility, consistency, and honest results. So they built Brashline — a digital agency designed for real people, not corporate budgets. No confusing retainers or inflated promises, just affordable, reliable, and practical solutions that help businesses look good, stay active, and grow online."
            - paragraph [ref=e79]: "The team's mission has stayed the same from day one: make technology work for small businesses, not against them. Whether it's creating steady social content, optimizing for search, or building websites that convert, Brashline keeps it simple, transparent, and effective."
            - paragraph [ref=e80]: Real people. Real support. Real results. That's Brashline.
